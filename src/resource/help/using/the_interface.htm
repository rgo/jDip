 <h1>The Interface</h1>
 <p>
 When a game has been started, the main window is divided into several functional groups:
 </p>
 
 <h2>Map Window</h2>
 <p>
 The map window shows the provinces, units, and orders. Orders may be entered
 with the mouse on the map. Via the <b>View</b> menu, you may change what the
 map will display.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Order Window</h2>
 <p>
 The top of the order window shows the current turn (Season, Year, and Phase).
 Below this is an area for entering orders via the keyboard (one of several ways
 to enter orders in jDip). A list of the current orders will be shown underneath.
 If the turn has been resolved, failed orders will be underlined. Orders may be 
 sorted using the sort-selector, which is underneath the order list.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Command Toolbar</h2>
 <p>
 The command toolbar changes depending upon what actions are allowed. Three options,
 <b>Best Fit</b>, <b>Zoom In</b>, and <b>Zoom Out</b> are always available. Other
 options (usually order-entry options) are available when orders may be entered.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Status Bar</h2>
 <p>
 The left part of the status bar displays useful information and helpful prompts. 
 When the mouse is over a province, information about that province is shown. 
 When entering orders, prompts and province information are shown.
 </p>
 <p>
 The far-right portion of the status bar displays <b>Ready</b> if orders may be
 entered, <b>Rendering...</b> if orders are currently being drawn, or the current
 "mode." For example, when reviewing previous turns that have been resolved, orders may not
 be entered; the word <b>REVIEW</b> will be shown.
