 <h1>Preferences</h1> 
 <p>
 Preferences control various options within jDip. Preferences are saved and recalled
 automatically. Options are arranged on different tabs within the Preferences window.
 </p> 
 
 <h2>General</h2>
  <h3>Restore last window size and position at restart</h3>
  <p>
  If selected, jDip will remember the last window size and position, and when 
  restarted, use these settings.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Show resolution results after orders are resolved</h3>
  <p>
  If selected, show the <b>Adjudication Results</b> window after orders have
  been resolved (adjudicated). Adjudication results are also available through
  the <b>Reports</b> menu.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Default save game directory</h3>
  <p>
  Select the default directory for save game files.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Clear recently used file list</h3>
  <p>
  Clears the files (if any are listed) in the most-recently-used file list, 
  which is located in the <b>File</b> menu. Note that this is not undoable.
  </p>
  
 <h2>Display</h2>
  <h3>Order Format</h3>
  <p>
  Determines how orders are formatted within the order list. An example order
  is shown so you can see how the formatting options affect how orders are displayed.
  </p>
 
 <h2>Export</h2>
  
  The export settings affect how PNG and JPEG maps are exported. It does not 
  affect PDF and SVG exported maps.
  
  <h3>Image Export Size</h3>
  <p>
  Exported map size may be scaled to the desired size. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>Image Export Settings</h3>
  
  <h4>JPEG Image Quality</h4>
  <p>
  Higher numbers are higher quality, and larger files. Lower numbers are lower
  quality and smaller files. Generally, a good compromise is in the 70-80 range.
  </p>
  
  <h4>Maximum Colors in PNG Images</h4>
  <p>
  PNG (Portable Network Graphics) files may be exported as 1, 2, 4, 8, or 32 
  bits-per-pixel (bpp) images. This corresponds to 2, 4, 16, 256, and "unlimited"
  colors, respectively. Images with fewer colors (fewer bits per pixel) 
  will be smaller but may have decreased quality.
