<h1>Version History: 0.80</h1>
<h2>jDip version 0.80 (August, 2002)</h2>
<pre>
    - Core changes:
        + Improved XML Variant and Adjacency format
        + New Variant plugin system, that actually works
        + ANT build file included
        + Support for game Metadata
        + Batik 1.5b3 included
        + TestSuite uses new Variant plugin system
    - GUI changes / improvements:
        + Larger status bar
        + Larger adjudication results window
        + Added Credits panel in About dialog
        + Adjudication results brought up by default
        + Menu cleanup
        + Game Name / Filename frame title display changes
        + System properties in About dialog are now sorted alphabetically
        + New Game dialog fixes/improvements
    - Bug fixes:
        + Edit mode menu item remains checked if new game started/loaded while in edit mode
        + Fixed unit placement for Galicia & Prussia on topological map
    - New features:
        + Game/Player metadata editor (Edit | Game & Player Info...)
    - Miscellaneous:
        + Started Judge History/Game information parsing; much code has
          been written & tested; estimate this feature is 75-80% complete. 
        + Adjudicator errors noticed; this is due to a code regression; 
          this will be remedied in the next release. The same error exists
          in the released 0.75 version as well. This should only affect 
          adjudication in unusual situations.
        + WARNING: Old save games are not compatible with this version.
          Save game format will freeze nearer to the 1.0 release.
