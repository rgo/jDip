        + API Documentation improvements and updates
        + Build.xml "Clean" and "Install" targets added (Mike Rosseel).
                "Install" target requires downloading the IzPack installer
        + DATC test case maps now are in a separate variant file (testVariants.zip)
        + Significant refactoring
                - judge.parser.OrderParser renamed to JudgeOrderParser
                - dip.order.Orderable interface created
                - dip.order.Order implements Orderable interface

        + Saved games are not compatible with previous version (version 0.86).
        + Order drawing will continue to improve throughout subsequent versions,
                both in style and in speed.
        + Difficult passable borders, used in some variants (e.g., Loeb9) are not yet supported.
        + For those requiring rapid adjudication (no GUI), please note that version 0.85 
                remains the baseline perfomance release. This version has an 
                approximately 7-8% performance deficit compared to version
                0.85. Performance optimizations will be addressed in future versions.
