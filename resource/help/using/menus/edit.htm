 <h2>Persistent Undo/Redo</h2>
 <p>
 Undo and Redo are persistent across saved games. This includes order resolutions,
 order additions, and edit-mode changes. Even several turns later in a game you 
 opened from weeks ago, you can undo all the actions that have occured since 
 the beginning of a game!
