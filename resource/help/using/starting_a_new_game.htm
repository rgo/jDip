<h1>Starting A New Game</h1>
 <p>
 To start a new game, select <b>New | Game...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
 The <i>New Game</i> window will then appear, with several tabs to set 
 the type of game and options for that game.
 </p>
 
 <h2>Variant Selection</h2>
 <p>
 A list of available variants is displayed on the left. When a variant is selected,
 its description will appear to the right, and available maps (some variants have
 more than one map choice) will appear at the lower-left. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Some variants have multiple maps. The map selection is not permanent; you may select
 a different map once the game has been created, by selecting <b>Select Map...</b>
 from the <b>View</b> menu
 </p>
 
 <h2>Map and Symbols</h2>

 from which to choose.

 Should you wish to change the map style or units after the game has started,
 this may be done from the <b>View | Map and Symbols...</b> menu
 </p>
