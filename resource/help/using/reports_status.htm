<h1>Status Reports</h1>
 <p>
 The current turn status is displayed in this window. This includes the current
 position of units on the board, supply center ownership, and the orders that 
 have been entered. If dislodged units are present, they too are listed along with
 valid retreat locations.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 If a player is not allowed to see the currently entered orders of another player
 (e.g., during face-to-face games), the orders will be shown as "not available".
