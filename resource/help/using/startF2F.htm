<h1>Starting A New Face-to-Face Game</h1>
 <p>
 To start a new game, select <b>New | Face-to-Face Game...</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
 The <i>New Face-to-Face Game</i> window will then appear, with several tabs to set 
 the type of game and options for that game.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that the options for a Face-to-Face game are the same as those for a 
 regular game. See <b>Starting a New Game</b> for more information on these options.
 
 
<h2>What are Face-to-Face games?</h2>
 <p>
 A face-2-face game (F2F) is a game where all players are together, in the same 
 room; using jDip, it is analagous to 'hot-seat' game, where each player enters
 his or her orders at the computer, one player at a time. 
 </p>
 <p>
 When a game is created as an F2F game, orders are entered in a restricted
 fashion. After a period of diplomacy, during which players may interact with each other,
 the players take turns entering their orders in secret. Players cannot see the orders another player
 has entered until the turn has been resolved. 
 </p>
 
<h2>Entering orders in a Face-to-Face game</h2>
 <p>
 When a tab with the desired power is clicked, only orders for that power may be entered.
 After a player has finished entering orders, he or she must submit them using the 
 <b>Submit Orders</b> button. A confirmation window will then be displayed.
 After orders have been submitted, <i>they cannot be
 changed in any way</i>. 
 </p>
 </p>
 When all powers have submitted orders, the turn will resolve. 
 Only when the turn has resolved are all orders visible.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A player may view the results and maps of previous turns using the <b>History</b> 
 menu or appropriate keyboard shortcuts. When reviewing prior turns, a player may
 select the <b>All</b> tab to see orders for all powers. Otherwise, the <b>All</b> tab
 is not available.
 </p>
 
 <p>
 A power's tab will be grayed-out (not selectable) when orders for that power have been 
 submitted. A tab may also be grayed-out if a power has no orders to 
 submit during a Retreat or Adjustment phase.
